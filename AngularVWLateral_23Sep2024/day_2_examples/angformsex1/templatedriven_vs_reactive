angular forms:
   1) template-driven forms
       ngModel - two-way-binding - FormsModule (import)
       form & form-controls structure -  html template
       code form validation , form styling - html template
   
       advantage:
         1) suitable small forms
       disadvantage:
         1) long forms with sub-forms - not suitable
	    form will be too much cluttered.doesn't look clean
         2) unit-testing template form - code in html template
   2) reactive-forms
       1) create entire structure form - class file
          all controls,nested controls,validations - .ts class file
          even if it is complex - access inside class file
          then u map it to the UI form
       2) unit-testing is easy as entire structure is
          in class file - unit test that class instance
       
       3) suitable for complex forms having multiple sub-forms
       4) html form will look clean (less-cluttered) 
       5) doesnt use ngModel
